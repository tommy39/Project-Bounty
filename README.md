A Demo Top Down Shooter Inspired by hotline miami in the wild west 

Project Bounty is a Top Down Shooter Prototype that I had worked on solo. It is heavily inspired by the games 'Hotline Miami' and '12 is better than 6'.

| Key Features:

Fast Paced Top-Down Action: Each shot is deadly, move quick to avoid being shot by enemies.

Multiple Weapons: Choose from weapons of different types including semi automatic and automatic weapons as well as shotguns with spread shot capabilities and use melee weapons. Pickup weapons dropped by enemies.

Editor Tools: Includes a patrol waypoint gizmo tool to display all points in a waypoint network as well as what order they waypoint is in the network list. AI also have a text displayed in the editor to show what State they are currently in. It also inclused the ability to change AI weapons and states and see them reflected at runtime in the editor for ease of use.
